      <h2>Facts About Doraemon</h2>
      <p>
        Doraemon is a robotic cat from the 22nd century who was sent back in time
        to help a young boy named Nobita Nobi. Unlike normal robots, Doraemon has
        emotions, friendships, and a strong sense of responsibility. He carries
        a four-dimensional pocket that can store futuristic gadgets, which he
        uses to help Nobita solve problems—often leading to unexpected trouble.
        Doraemon is afraid of mice, despite being a robot, and loves dorayaki
        (sweet red bean pancakes).

      <p>
        Doraemon was created by Fujiko F. Fujio and first appeared in 1969.
        Although he looks like a blue cat, he originally had ears that were
        eaten by a robot mouse, which caused his fear of mice. Doraemon has
        become a cultural icon in Japan and many other countries, representing
        friendship, imagination, and hope for a better future through
        technology.
